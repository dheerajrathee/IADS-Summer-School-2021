# IADS-SummerSchool-2021

This repository is created for my course to be delivered during [Institute of Analytics and Data Science Summer School 2021](https://www.iadssummerschool.com/).

## Course Abstract:
Tree-based models e.g. Decision trees are supervised learning models used for problems involving classification and regression. These models offer a high level of flexibility that leads to an advantage towards capturing the complex non-linear relationships, however, makes these models more prone to memorizing the noise present in data. By aggregating the predictions of several decision trees that are randomly trained, ensemble methods take advantage of the flexibility feature while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. In this course, participants will learn how to work with tree-based models to solve data science problems in Python.

Everything from using a single tree for regression or classification to more advanced ensemble methods will be covered. Participants start learning about basic CARTs (classification and regression trees) followed by implementation of bagged trees, Random Forests, and boosted trees using the Gradient Boosting Machine, or GBM. The course will include dedicated practical sessions for these techniques and allow the participant to create high performance tree-based models for a real-world dataset.

## Practical Elements:
This course is part theory and part practical. For the practical exercise, participants will learn how to implement Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms to real-world datasets using Python on Google Colab platform.


## Prerequisites/knowledge:
Basic working knowledge of python prgramming language and Jupyter Notebook platform.

## Will I be using any particular software?
Jupyter and Python

## Will I need to bring a laptop, or download anything in advance? 
Participants can bring their laptops otherwise can use systems available in the labs. As all practical session will run over Google Colab, participants need to make an account on Google Collab platform.

## Will I need to prepare anything in advance?
Participants need to make an account on Google Collab platform.
